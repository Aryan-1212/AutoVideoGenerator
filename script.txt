Have you ever wondered how cold a temperature can be? Welcome back to Know This!

The coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth is minus 128.6 degrees Fahrenheit or minus 89.2 degrees Celsius. This was measured at the Soviet Union's Vostok Station in Antarctica on July 21, 1983.

But temperatures can get even colder in space. In the Boomerang Nebula, about 5,000 light-years from Earth, scientists have recorded temperatures as low as minus 458 degrees Fahrenheit or minus 272 degrees Celsius. This is just one degree above absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature.

Absolute zero is the theoretical temperature where all atomic motion stops. It is minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit or minus 273.15 degrees Celsius. At this point, particles have no kinetic energy, making it the ultimate limit of cold.
